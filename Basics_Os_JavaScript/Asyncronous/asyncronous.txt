Asyncronous is a non-bloking architecture so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another .
Task can run symultaneouly.


difference between async and sync

 1) async is multithreaded  wich means operations or programs        1) synchronous is single-thread, so only one operation or program 
           can run in parallel.                                                         will run at a time.
 2) async is non-blocking which meand it will send multiple          2) Sync is blocking â€” it will only send the server one request at a time 
               request on server at a time.                                  and will wait for that request to be answered by the server.
