A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code

A JavaScript Promise object can be:

Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected

While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
